# Password-Generator

## Description
The purpose of this project was to develop a way to produce a password, producing different and random results depending on the criteria chosen by the user. The user is able to choose
if their password will have upper or lowercase characters, numbers, and/or special characters. Through Javascript, a password will be generated based on the user's selection criteria.

## Installation
As this is a web application, no installation is necessary.

## Usage
Navigate to the site page [here]() and click "generate password". The site will prompt you with several options as to what characters you would like your password to contain, as well as the password length. After all prompts have been answered, your newly generated password will appear in the text box, located center of the screen.
